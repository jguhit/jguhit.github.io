# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This is where I showcase my projects and share my journey in Particle Physics, Data Science and Computing.

## Introduction
I have created this portfolio to succinctly present my body of work to potential employers in the industry. As a PhD student at the University of Michigan, currently stationed at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, for the duration of my doctoral program, I have had the privilege of engaging in diverse and impactful projects spanning both physics research and software development.

## Portfolio Overview
This portfolio is aimed at professionals in the industry, including consulting firms, financial institutions, and technology companies. It provides a comprehensive view of my academic and professional journey, highlighting key projects and experiences that showcase my skills and capabilities.

## Projects
### Project 1: Time Series Ensembles (Open Source Project with DSML)
- *Description*: In collaboration with the Data Science and Machine Learning (DSML) group based in New York City, New York, I contribute to an open source project focused on time series analysis. My work involves software development, particularly in the realm of financial stock data analysis. This project has allowed me to gain valuable experience in data preprocessing, manipulation, and analysis, bridging my background in pure physics with practical data science.

### Project 2: Combination Searches of Di-Higgs Pair Production
- *Description*: Another significant contribution during my PhD involves the combination of three highly sensitive analyses in di-higgs pair production. This project requires a meticulous calculation of the final results, and I play a key role in this aspect of the analysis.

### Project 3: Di-Higgs Search in the bbtautau Final State 
- *Description*: One of my primary research endeavors during my PhD is the di-higgs search in the bbtautau final state at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This analysis is highly specialized, focusing on a specific decay channel within the LHC. My role as the main analyzer encompasses framework development, the development of machine learning models for signal-background separation, statistical analysis, and serving as the paper editor.

### Project 4: FPGA Radiation Test for the ATLAS Experiment
- *Description*: Beyond data analysis, I have engaged in a noteworthy project involving the programming of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) using VHDL. Additionally, I developed a graphical user interface (GUI) program using the PyQt Module in Python to control the hardware during radiation experiments, store data, and conduct analysis.

### Project 5: NetBASILISK (Security Infrastructure Project)
- *Description*: In collaboration with the University of Michigan Computer Science Department, I led a project called NetBASILISK. This security infrastructure project involved the creation of a benchmark framework for simulating data transfers and calculating statistical information. Additionally, I designed an environmental framework to extract network metrics during data transfers and correlate the results with the benchmark framework.
