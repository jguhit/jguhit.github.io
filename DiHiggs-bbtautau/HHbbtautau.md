# Project Background 
Since the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, a particle central to our understanding of physics, teams at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) - specifically the ATLAS and CMS collaborations - have been delving into its properties. Their research aims to verify how well this particle aligns with the Standard Model of particle physics, the current best theory describing fundamental particles and forces. Particularly, they are examining the Higgs boson's mass, which is measured to be around 125 GeV, and confirming that its observed characteristics are in line with theoretical predictions.

A key focus of this research is exploring how Higgs bosons interact with themselves and with other particles, such as W and Z bosons. These interactions are described by specific parameters like trilinear and quartic self-couplings. Scientists measure the frequency of processes where pairs of Higgs bosons are produced - primarily through gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion - to understand these interactions. Accurate measurements of these occurrences help researchers verify if the Higgs boson behaves as our theories predict or if there are signs of new physics beyond our current understanding.
