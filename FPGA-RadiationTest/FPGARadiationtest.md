# Project Background 

The 2012 discovery of the Higgs boson by the ATLAS experiment at CERN was a significant milestone in particle physics, validating the theory of electroweak symmetry breaking. While this discovery shed light on how particles gain mass through their interaction with the Higgs field, it also opened the door to further investigations into the Higgs boson's properties and its interactions with other particles. To facilitate a better understanding, the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) is an anticipated upgrade to the existing LHC. The HL-LHC is set to increase particle collisions by a factor of five, greatly enhancing the radiation environment.  The University of Michigan is contributing to the upgrades with the development of the Chamber Service Module (CSM). The CSM is a key component of the precision tracking system in the ATLAS experiment's muon architecture.  Designed as a multiplexer, the CSM manages data acquisition and transmission using mezzanine cards, ensuring compatibility with existing and future cards to handle increased data bandwidth and radiation levels.

One of the main challenges in a high-radiation environment is the risk of Single Event Upsets (SEUs) - errors where radiation changes a data bit to an incorrect value, often due to energetic particles interacting with sensitive components. These “bitflips” in electronic devices can corrupt data streams, leading to inconsistencies and reduced muon system efficiency. Recognizing the potential damage SEUs can cause to our hardware upgrades, we propose an in-depth SEU evaluation of the CSM at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE).
